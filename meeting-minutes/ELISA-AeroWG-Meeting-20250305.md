# Technical Topics

[Link to 2025 goals](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/meeting-minutes/ELISA-AeroWG-Meeting-20250205.md#2025-vision-and-direction)

## Whitepaper on "Survey State of Art...""


Background
- Edits
  - Via online [Overlead editor](https://www.overleaf.com/) - we have limited licenses so we've shared the pdf link below
  - latex format and editor can generate documents
- Paper's goal - What is the current state of the art with respect to aerospace
  - Initial document drove use case definition
  - Evolved to be a comparison and a conclusion of industry direction
  - Doc still informs goals and activities of AeroWG
- Martin has restructured the paper based on previous discussion
  - Why the paper / oveview
  - Why would you use OSS in safety critical
  - Challenges
  - Overview
    - closed solutions
    - RTOS  in Aero
    - Linux in other industries
    - Linux in aero and related considerations
  - Comparison / conclusion / criteria
- Paper started really focused and restructure started when the group became more diverse with standards and concerns
  - Suggestion in this call was to consider adjusting the standards language to not just focus on DO-178C but consider NASA / MIL guidance.

Open discussion
  - Martin documented some actions in the whitepaper's todo section.  Some have owners, others could be adopted.  (Need Overlead access to view these)
  - Do we need to work the action on building our dictionary? (Matt W volunteering)
  - Space has a mission, how does that map/play with Aerospace using OSS?
  - Section 5.3 safety critical linux in other industries
    - How are they doing it so we can build on it for aerospace's perspective
    - Could capture some functional safety container usage concepts to start decomposing containers use in Aerospace.
- Why open source, do the aero cases fit for space?
- Brennan
  - RTOS selection mostly driven by security and some performance characteristics (e.g., timing)
    - Influenced by novel arch and how communication is managed
  - multi-RTOS could be a factor in a system design
    - [MW]: Mix of non-Linux plus Linux, could drive use cases and other activities outside of being in the initial Whitepaper.
- Ivan
  - Should we step back? In 2 mins how could you describe what this is about, then build abstract, grow to outline - write
  - Proposed title: Survey on State-of-the-Art Open-Source Systems in Aerospace.


**Open actions**
- [Matt W] Ask SGL SIG about charts from the containers talk in Feb.
- [ALL] [Document for feedback - Draft(March 5th, 2025 revision)](../docs/20250305_ELISA_AeroWG_Whitepaper.pdf)
  - Note: Add your feedback within the document if you have edit access and prefix with your initials plus colon.  Otherwise, start a new email thread on the aero mailing list.
  - Completely read the document.
  - Propose what you believe the abstract is for this paper.  How would you describe it in a couple mins.
  - What gaps do you see?
  - What is unclear?
  - Confirm what you're committing to add.
  - Be ready for next call
    -  Restructuring content
    -  Re-write abstract
    -  Assigning of editors for updates

## Discussion on Features for Aerospace
- Call between Ivan, Martin, Paul, Brian Wood, and I is occurring on testing wkly on Friday @ 9-9:30am CST. The meeting focuses on discussing the testing framework and how to prototype the components together. Anyone is welcome to join us and contact Matt Weber for the invite.
- Minutes from 2/28/2025
  - Ivan: worked on adding some extensions for co-pilot (quick update). Here's a command for his install: `cabal install --lib copilot copilot-c99 copilot-language copilot-theorem copilot-libraries copilot-interpreter`
  - Martin: was working up a user document and capturing some issues encountered by his students and put this into a writeup (needs to be cleaned up since some of the screenshots are in German so would need update to English).
