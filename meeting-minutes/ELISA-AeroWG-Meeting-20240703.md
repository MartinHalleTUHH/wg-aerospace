## ELISA Aerospace Working Group

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.

# Technical Topics

## Old Business

- Space Grade Linux action - Contacted Monaghan, Michael L. (GSFC-5870) <michael.l.monaghan@nasa.gov> to work on agenda and topics
  - Tentatively planning to have the first Aug WG session Space focused

- Do we need to introduce a dictionary? One example of a question that was raised:   Is this covered in another WG?
  - What is the understanding of "multiple functions"? -> 3 Answers with 9 people
    - 1) Multiple PCI devices SATA, USB, network etc.
    - 2) PCI devices with multiple functions, root bridge can have multiple functions
    - 3) System function perspective: Applications (processes, tasks, functions as S/W components) to achieve a system function like switch on cabin light (example: read sensor, log data, report failure, drive actuator)
  - Tend to a common understanding of 3)

- (ToDo) Check with Min/Kate for Automotive's approach for previous use cases.  "What is the feedback approach / rollout for the use cases?  Audience?"

- (ToDo) Use the mailing list to build a list of questions for a survey.  Questions would cover topics like what distro / Linux approach they are using and how they use it, compose it, and cfg they depend on, etc. - Used to drive our next use case and timeline.

## Linux Features for Safety-Critical Systems (LFSCS)
- Tiny Kernel and QEMU target - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-lfscs/blob/main/lfscs-meetings/20240611.md
- Link to Arch WG minutes & Minimal Application - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-lfscs/blob/main/lfscs-meetings/20240625.md


## Discussion on Features for Aerospace

Continue the discussion series, now in a separate document:
