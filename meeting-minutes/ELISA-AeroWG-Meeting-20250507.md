# Technical Topics

## Demo of Cabin Lights Use Case

See [Readme](../demos/copilot/Readme.md).

- Drives other WG discussion, minimal configurations, and practice of monitor-based verfication
- Practice has application for operational monitor use cases
- Join us Friday 9am CDT - invite - https://elisa.tech/community/meetings/

## Whitepaper on "Survey State of Art...""

Background
- Edits
  - Via online [Overleaf editor](https://www.overleaf.com/) - we have limited licenses so we've shared the pdf link below
  - latex format and editor can generate documents
- Paper's goal - What is the current state of the art with respect to aerospace
  - Initial document drove use case definition
  - Evolved to be a comparison and a conclusion of industry direction
  - Doc still informs goals and activities of AeroWG & Space

[Worked on Abstract - TDB updated copy link](../docs/20250417_ELISA_AeroWG_Whitepaper.pdf) today

ACTIONS
- Martin is going to finish the abstract and move the portions "marked for Intro" into the Intro section.  Next time focusing on Intro.
