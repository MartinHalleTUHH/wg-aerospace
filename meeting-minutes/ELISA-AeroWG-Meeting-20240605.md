# Space Grade Linux

- Outbrief from 2nd organizing call (Scot gave a brief discussion for ~10mins and had to drop.)
  - Mike Monaghan NASA (focal as Scot transitions) - has flexibility in time to focus on this and working with Kate to outline steps  (Monaghan, Michael L. (GSFC-5870) <michael.l.monaghan@nasa.gov>)
    - ACTION, need to identify for next call if we can do an agenda with Michael.
  - Tim Bird - took action to reach out to other Space related linux groups

- Agenda (Next meeting when Mike/Kate join)
  - Cadance / Frequency of this meeting
  - Ideas on future agenda topics

# Discussion on Features for Aerospace

Continue discussion series, now in separate document:
[Aerospace-Uses-Cases](../Aerospace-Uses-Cases.md)

The conversation was around the Next Steps section of the document. (A short 20min conversation)

- What is our output of the use case?  Suggestion to define a result we can measure/use.  Do we have this in a early meeting's minutes?
  - Whitepaper has a tangible reason / visible result.
  - Is it to attempt to define the core of linux for other influencing reasons?
  - safety vs non-safety?  What is the value for non-safety use cases in this group?
    - Aero - smallest feature set for cert
      - Is there a example of this to compare against SpaceROS requirement matrix? Is that comparison valuable?
    - Space - less critical more functionality - Goal? alignment of usage and artifacts - drive maturity / streamlines certification
        - Ivan mentioned there was evaluation of SpaceROS against lowest criticality (TBD planning to publish a guide / matrix for requirement compliance in SpaceROS)
  - One suggestion is to present the use cases for feedback (find a wider audience and what distro / linux approach are they using.  survey how they use it, compose it and cfg they depend on)
    - This drives a timeline and output plan so others can use it
- If the use case implied a distro, what would it be based on or would it follow a pattern like carrier grade that standardizes a configuration. (for the few of us on the call)Leaning towards a pattern/standard.  e.g., Yocto/RHEL/Ubuntu using a pattern with artifacts living in core projects.  So maybe for the current aerospace use case we could reuse the Automotive Yocto configuration?
  - Need to checkout ref build that automative did for their use case.

# Other business

- Carried over from previous meeting...
  - Do we need to introduce a dictionary? One example of a question that was raised:
    - What is the understanding of "multiple functions"? -> 3 Answers with 9 people
      - 1) Multiple PCI devices SATA, USB, network etc.
      - 2) PCI devices with multiple functions, root bridge can have multiple functions
      - 3) System function perspective: Applications (processes, tasks, functions as S/W components) to achieve a system function like switch on cabin light (example: read sensor, log data, report failure, drive actuator)
	- **NEW**: Tend to a common understanding of 3)
