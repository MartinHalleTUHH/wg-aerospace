## FSW submission

Title: Making Penguins Fly

Abstract: This presentation will touch on the objectives, challenges, and developments of the Enabling Linux in Safety Applications (ELISA) foundation's Aerospace and Space Grade Linux working group (WG.) The presentation will include specific topics from a Dec 10-12 Goddard Space Flight Center workshop.  ELISA was formed to make it easier for companies to build and certify Linux-based safety-critical applications â€“ systems whose failure could result in loss of human life, significant property damage, or environmental damage. ELISA members are working together to define and maintain a common set of tools and processes that can help companies demonstrate that a Linux-based system meets the necessary safety requirements for certification. The Aerospace Working Group develops use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, works to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seeks to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable the use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels. Space grade Linux, which recently made its open-source debut as an ELISA Special Interest Group (SIG), is a collaborative, open-source project bringing together space agencies, industry, academia, and non-profit organizations to establish a trusted ecosystem of Linux-based, open-source software for mission-critical spacecraft operations.

Please join Matthew Weber and Michael Monaghan for this presentation on Making Penguins Fly. Matt is a Chief Software Architect at The Boeing Company and Chair of the Aerospace WG. Matt's 18 years of experience focuses on leveraging open-source software into embedded aerospace and defense systems. Michael is a Software Engineer at NASA and leads the Space Grade Linux SIG. Michael has developed Linux-based software at NASA for over 8 years at Goddard Space Flight Center. Michael has worked on various cubesats, ISS experiments, and custom processor cards throughout his career.


## Discussion on Features for Aerospace

Next use case (Space focused?)
  - What are the dependencies for running frameworks (CFS, etc) on top?
    - Using CFS dockerfile as setup instructions for the userspace part plus look at what is required in minimal kernel
  - Would this apply to cubesats?  (Could start here and grow towards larger example?)
    - Could be used for incubating university projects (Michael)
  - Impacts to criticality/rigor (what standards would apply in a cubesat case? Class C? )
    - Criticality & cost factors into Class
  - Any feedback from the survey that could help inform this?
  - https://www.polysat.org/
    - From: https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1720&context=eesp
    - "the PolySat software architecture runs entirely on a custom Linux operating system"
    - Maybe a group for user feedback for what we define (design, prototype)
  - https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-cube-one-marco/ 
  - https://www.asi.it/en/planets-stars-universe/solar-system-and-beyond/liciacube/
  - NASA Spark - https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/prizes-challenges-crowdsourcing-program/center-of-excellence-for-collaborative-innovation-coeci/nasa-spark/
    - SpaceROS advancements
    - Could use as a way for the community to contribute
    - Starting point for us - having an example deployment/build and some basic documentation
  - Stoke is resurrecting this one (Chris): https://github.com/SOL-Space-Operating-Linux/meta-sol
    - (MIT License) https://github.com/SOL-Space-Operating-Linux/Documentation/blob/master/LICENSE
  - Where would we host the space examples and what licensing / CLAs (https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/easycla/)?  (Michael checking internal to NASA on how this might work)
    - ACTION - Matt to follow up with Michael, Kate and Ramon to see if this is a SIG topic we breakout for.
    - Could start to breakout Space community building topic

<br>

The use case discussion is focusing on testing.  
- We are seeking volunteers to write the test apps and stage an emulation environment based on the discussion.  Contact Matt Weber if interested.
- Moved the notes on emulation approaches to a ref section in use case document
- (Ivan) I have the Copilot code ready. It's very simple.
  - From the point of view of connecting it to the rest of the testing infrastructure, all I need is:
    - A boolean (global variable) that indicates if the light switch is on or off.
    - A boolean (global variable) that indicates if the lights are on.
  - I can also connect it if you give me a function that allows me to "sense" if the light switch is on/off, and whether the lights are on/off. There are other ways to connect it (e.g., SW bus, etc.).
