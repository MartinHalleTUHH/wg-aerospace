# Technical Topics

## Requirements for OS used in Use-Cases
  - Should we capture the reasons for being different (timing, footprint, simplicity, minimization, radiation, etc)? [YES but with caution]
    - Carrier set high level threshold and then distros could show they met the requirements
      - Performance and promotional - prove productization of Linux is real in commercial cases
    - Need at least a charter / scope
    - What are our themes / KPIs which would justify capturing this as different?
      - e.g. stronger EDAC  (Suggested by Tim and Rob has interest)
      - ACTION: Next call topic on KPI?
  - Where should we capture these?
    - Could use paper approach to guide (model/lessons learned) this and similar structure to Carrier content?  Could be split of the basics of minimal system vs distro level features (e.g. even between AeroWG/SGL)
  - Patterns
    - Could we follow the Carrier Grade Linux example? “config guidance plus self-compliance approach”
      - https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/cgl/start
      - https://www.static.linuxfound.org/sites/main/files/CGL_5.0_Specification.pdf
    - Just tooling?  Could extend https://github.com/elisa-tech/kconfig-safety-check ?
    - Example of minimal config work - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-lfscs/tree/main/min_prog_trace
      - LFSCS mission https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-lfscs/blob/main/mission.md
    - Automotive grade linux definitions
      - https://www.automotivelinux.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/08/agl_spec_v1_280515.pdf
      - https://www.automotivelinux.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/06/GoogleDrive_The-AGL-software-defined-connected-car-architecture.pdf
  - How do we do it in a way to be inclusive of other distros?


## Meeting times / slots

ACTION: Need to setup next meeting call - email pending with ELISA on getting Zoom call

We’ve had a few discussions in different calls about adjusting our meeting frequency and aligning time slots.

What are everyone’s thoughts on these options that get our calls consistently at the same times so the slots better align as a recurring meeting each week.

Wednesday10-11am CDT
- 1st wk – AerospaceWG
- 2nd wk – Space SIG
- 3rd wk – AerospaceWG Paper  (new call)
- 4th wk – Space SIG

Thursday 10-11am CDT
- 1st wk – Aerospace
- 2nd wk – Space SIG
- 3rd wk – AerospaceWG Paper (new call)
- 4th wk – Space SIG

## Alternative Environments for Use-Cases

(Wanja presenting nixos - https://nixos.org/)

Problem space - what is an env we can use to build kernels and systems for demostration.  (build, debug, compose)

- Minimal kernel - tiny config
  - nix abstraction to support multiple architectures (conditional kconfig)  plus multiple Kernel revs
- System building
  - Has a split of initramfs and kernel builds
  - nix composition via config that defines the ramfs content
  - Wrappers QEMU launch
  - Wrapper for QEMU kernel debugging

Single command, reproducible workflow if you have nix shell.
Reference snapshot (Wanja): https://github.com/wucke13/minimal-nixos/

Questions
- Is this the step to hardware configs / bsp support?
- Where does this fit between AeroWG or SGL?  AeroWG is chartered to define "use cases" and we stretched that to provide example demos.  Does this just provide organizing of "demos"?
- Could initially cleanup https://gitlab.com/elisa-tech/aero-wg/demo-cert-linux/-/blob/main/build_minimal.sh?ref_type=heads using this approach?  MRs welcome!

## Parking lot items

Lab grid project
- Lab grid is a board managment framework (similar Lava)
- E.g. deploy SW to board, configure SUT etc. into different configurations
- Greatly facilitates a test frameworks, by managing HW in convenient way
    - Coordinates/manages connections to board (serial, power, usb)
- Comes with a PyTest plugin
- ACTION: Invite Lab grid developers to present capabilities and background? https://github.com/emantor
- ACTION (Matt): Mention to Ramon as this might be good for SGL call
