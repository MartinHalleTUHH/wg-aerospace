## ELISA Aerospace Working Group

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.

# Technical Topics

## GitHub discussions

https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/discussions

- You're invited to add new discussions
- Gives you a chance to upvote items

## Use case demo

Goals
- Lowering the level of entry
- Clear tool setup
- Examples of customizing a concept/configuration
- Recreation and observation of a demo
- Discussion on how to tailor/capture specific attributes of the system for other use cases
- Development of new content

[Expected use survey](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/meeting-minutes/ELISA-AeroWG-Meeting-20250605.md?plain=1#L148)

### Update

-	Brief update on Use Case demo work
  - [Cabin Lights](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/tree/main/demos/copilot)
    - Completed - native python demo of the CoPilot monitor and rehosted into a minimal ARM64 Linux
    - Completed - similar demo with raw sockets and targeting a minimal Linux
    - Next step - documentation and present the demo
    - Next step - get experience from users / feedback
  - NASA Core Flight System (cFS) - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/pull/92
    - Completed - Experimenting with a build for minimal ARM64 Linux emulation
    - Proposing new "NASA cFS running Light Switch app"

- Hardware in the Loop - could use an accessible drone/HW people can access
  - Previous actions / discussion
    - Ivan - checking with CalPoly team (had some F' work shown at IEEE conf)
    - Anyone looking for student projects?
    - Any SGL drone/HW ideas that come to mind that we should entertain?


## Whitepaper on "Survey State of Art..."

- Paper's goal - "What is the current state of the art with respect to aerospace"
- Initial document drove use case definition
  - Evolved to be a comparison and a conclusion of industry direction
  - Doc still informs goals and activities of AeroWG & Space

### Next steps
  - Establishing a separate call of "core contributors"
  - Charter: “To focus on providing contributions and working through open actions to get to a first draft.  Attendees are committed to participating in review and providing timely material.”
  - Initial Goals:
    -	Complete background and problem statement sections
    -	Add a cabin system example to show how to add supporting survey sections
    -	Present completed section material to larger group for feedback
  - If you're interested, select ALL possible meeting times that work for you!  https://doodle.com/group-poll/participate/axj6nV9d
