## Mandate

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.

# Developing a Minimal, Community Linux Platform for Aerospace

- Scope for feature selection
  - Technical scope
    - Software
      - first, discuss kernel (try to finish, and only discuss broader distribution if necessary to make a decision about kernel)
        - subsystem by subsystem, by DAL
		- protocol stacks
      - second, full distribution (kernel, services, BSP/drivers, API, libraries, applications, bootloader, etc.)
	  - Decision postponed to after system architecture
    - Hardware
      - MMU as minimum?, multicore?, availability (physical or simulation at first), validation, crypto, etc.
	  - Decision postponed after system architecture
  - Certification scope 
    - Option A: Non-critical - discuss first, DAL-D and lower
      - Decisions about features to include at low DAL do not (necessarily) apply to high DAL
    - Option B: Mission-critical
      - Real-time
    - Option C: Safety-critical (DO-178C SWL-C or higher)
      - Real-time
    - Option D: Security-critical (DO-326A, DO-356A)
      - SAL may not follow DAL, but may actually need to be inverse
    - Agreed on a broader group: Option A
  - Location
    - Air
    - Space
    - Ground equipment - secondary discussion
	  - Agreed on a broader group: Exclude ground equipment in the first phase
- Use Cases
  - confirmed Option A for system architecture, option D for use case. 
  - Use case now moved to separate document [Aerospace-Uses-Cases](../Aerospace-Uses-Cases.md)
  - Clarified: What about the other 2 votes (A and B), do we exclude people?
      - Option D is at least reasonable to pursue, perhaps others found another option more interesting, but we agree Option D will be pursued first. One of the votes last week for other options present again today agreed with this statement.
- Identification of features for use cases
- Mechanisms to configure features (include/exclude)
  - connection to partitioning
  - features that are included/excluded in a real-time aspect
  - different safety features that configured and are certified at different levels (e.g., DO-178C software level)
    - may exclude features, e.g., exclude any feature certified below DAL-B
- Maintenance and Support
  - Need to maintain for decades
- Tools
  - Identify features unique to aerospace, DO-330 qualification

# Other business

  - Do we need to introduce a dictionary? One example of a question that was raised:
    - What is the understanding of "multiple functions"? -> 3 Answers with 9 people
      - 1) Multiple PCI devices SATA, USB, network etc.
      - 2) PCI devices with multiple functions, root bridge can have multiple functions
      - 3) System function perspective: Applications (processes, tasks, functions as S/W components) to achieve a system function like switch on cabin light (example: read sensor, log data, report failure, drive actuator)
	- **NEW**: Tend to a common understanding of 3)
