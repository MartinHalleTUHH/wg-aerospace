# Announcements

Checkout our [Aerospace working group](https://lists.elisa.tech/g/aerospace) page as part of the ELISA foundation.  It includes a schedule of events, link to join the mailing lists, meeting minutes, and [seminar library](https://elisa.tech/seminar-series/).  

## Meetings

- For 2025, we keep our current schedule of two calls a month, but instead of different start times, they are now sync'd to both be at 4pm UTC (10am CST).  The first call of the month is Aerospace focused and the second Space.
  - **Do we want a 30mins pre-call for Aerospace before the SGL call on the 3rd Thurs of the month?  This would bring us back to two possible touch points a month.**
- (Per TSC) Starting from January 6th, we will use the LFX Meeting for all ELISA meetings. For a sneak peak of what that may look like please go to the ELISA public meeting calendar here https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/elisa-project.  The meeting joining links will change and more details to receive a direct calendar invite will be shared as migration completes.

## 2025 Vision and Direction

- Where do we take use cases activities this year?
    - Do we work with systems working group to define certification scope categories?  Chuck referenced Steve's paper has been used in current discussions.
        - Do we summarize this in some way to inform and clarify overlap between sgl + aero use cases? Helps industry align.
    - Layer for yocto project - drive technical software focus
        - May have less kernel focus then expected (Tim) - Noticed this with Sat project use of vendor provided content
        - flight framework examples - focused towards scenarios that fit customers profiles of use & test cases toward deployment configurations
            - i.e. cFS in a layer ready to integrate
        - flight control sw - https://ardupilot.org/
        - SGL started a layer last month - https://github.com/elisa-tech/meta-sgl
    - Commercial Aero Process tooling
        - Req and test trace to meta-layer content - "assurance"
          - Linux Plumbers discussion - [Improving kernel design documentation and involving experts](https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1894/)
          - Dec Goddard Workshop presentation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N3l_EEV8uM&list=PLuDNrzTpK8zqUX6OEuh2hEz3vmqyjlwYu&index=7&pp=iAQB
          
        - Copilot framework / examples to tie verification to use case applications
            - Tie as a concept with Linux Req and Trace verification effort (Martin / Chuck discussion on grad project?)
            - Runtime monitor framework example - https://github.com/nasa/ogma
- Restart "Survey State of Art" paper?  (briefly discussed in previous calls)
  - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/docs/20240418_ELISA_AeroWG_Whitepaper.pdf
  - Option B was selected in 20240321 & 20240403 calls
    - Option A) Scope is on a detailed comparison of some selected options (subset) of all options available (not mentioned in the paper)
    - **Option B) Broader scope whats available, motivation as an outcome, detailed comparison with a subset as second paper**
  - Maybe a SIG outside of main call?  Start with main talk, breakdown into SIGs?
  - Restructure/ breakout discussions
  - Add flight framework comparison to the RTOS listing?  ref Ivan's paper?
      - **Manuel / Ivan / Dongshik have interest - need whitepaper access**
  - Tim mentioned a survey of Linux use on Sats that just launched in early 2025 (Tomas N. has more information) - Mentioned a thesis paper is in development by a Czech student
      - **Tim needs whitepaper access**
      - SATGUS (https://www.spaceselfie.com/) mid-Jan 2025 - https://www.nanosats.eu/sat/sat-gus
          - 3-5 Linux instances
          - Crunchlabs
      - SuperDove SAT - low earth orbit imaging ~140 already up
          - Peican-2 from PlanetLab has Jetson - launched from transporter-12
          - https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-launches-high-resolution-pelican-2-satellite-36-superdoves/

## Discussion on Features for Aerospace
- Call between Ivan, Martin, Paul, Brian Wood, and I is occurring on testing wkly on Friday @ 9-9:30am CST. The meeting focuses on discussing the testing framework and how to prototype the components together. Anyone is welcome to join us and contact Matt Weber for the invite.
  - Actions from 1/31/2025
    -	Ivan â€“ Pushed PR - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/pull/15
      - Matt W to add comments on PR with entrypoint and ubuntu user added (DONE)
      -	Brian to share some raw socket examples
    -	Paul has a start on the py test apps and is looking at syslog integration with Ivanâ€™s work
    -	Matt to see if we can get a qemu build in place that we can run this in
  - Actions from 1/24/2025
    -	Ivan - pushing a PR that includes the Dockerfile setting of the environment plus a elisa-monitors/elisa-monitors.cabal that presets the configuration
    -	Matt W - Example of raw Ethernet frames and sniffing them (Ivan to test)
    -	Document container uid/gid details for developer experience - Matt W to see if he can release entrypoint script
    -	Demo to use UDP and syslog - monitors initially will just look at syslog entry transitions (time bound based on use case 500ms)
      - Split into second demo with docker --privileged which would allow the raw MAC frame example - monitors can look at syslog and pkts
  - Actions from 1/17/2025
    -	Ivan - push a PR with example Copilot monitor/spec and Dockerfile
    -	Brian - verify we can use raw ethernet frames within a ubuntu container for the app communication plus copilot can be in raw mode to sample the ethernet traffic.
    -	Matt - update PR with feedback from call that breaks out the instructions steps into a simpler progression
      -	PR with start of instructions outline - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/pull/12
    -	Martin - try the instructions after Matt pushes updates and plans to checkout Ivan's example PR
