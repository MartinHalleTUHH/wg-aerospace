# Technical Topics

## Old Business

- Space Grade Linux
  - Contacted Monaghan, Michael L. (GSFC-5870) <michael.l.monaghan@nasa.gov> to work on agenda and topics
  - Tentatively planning to have the first Aug WG session Space focused
  - [MW] is meeting with Kate Stewart on 07/16 to discuss SMCIT conference and LXF plans for Space Grade work

## Linux Features for Safety-Critical Systems (LFSCS)

(Email sent on 7/16 to mailing list) https://lists.elisa.tech/g/linux-features/topic/questions_from_the_aero_wg/107253914

- **ACTION**: How is the topic space being organized (e.g., component/subsystem driven)?
- **ACTION**:  Can LFSCS present on the minimal kernel and emulation?  (Building a conversation towards "Could this be used for targeting our use case?")

Boeing is adding a new LFSCS focal to support architecture and subsystem discussions.

## Discussion on Features for Aerospace

[Collaboration link for Use Case development](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/xu58a5s8qj-elisa-aerowg-a8x2?lang=en)

Continue the discussion series, now in a separate document:
[Aerospace-Uses-Cases](../Aerospace-Uses-Cases.md) -- [[Next steps]](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/Aerospace-Uses-Cases.md#foreseeable-next-steps-tbc-at-on-of-the-next-meetings)
