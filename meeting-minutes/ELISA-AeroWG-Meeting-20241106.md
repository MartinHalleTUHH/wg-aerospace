# Technical Topics

## December 10-12 Workshop
- Registration link above under events
- Any discussion for our call?

## Discussion on Features for Aerospace

The use case discussion is focusing on testing.  
- Here's the previous progress - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/commit/693faa39ac5d45073989c94877391f5742fb3c0f#diff-49514acd2e9fa371ee74afa185098ec9d80ca9305dabc98fa5fe00d79c3619d5
- We are seeking volunteers to write the test apps and stage an emulation environment based on the discussion.  Contact Matt Weber if interested.
