# Technical Topics

## Space Grade Linux (SGL)

- (tentative) Discuss remaining Survey details and Review landing page content

## Discussion on Features for Aerospace

New CI project for AeroWG with the intent to showcase demos and other workflow examples - https://gitlab.com/elisa-tech/aero-wg-ci

In a prior meeting, we stopped at "use cases" and "System functional tests / measurement (blackbox)".

Continue the discussion series, now in a separate document:
[Aerospace-Uses-Cases](../Aerospace-Uses-Cases.md) -- [[Next steps]](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/Aerospace-Uses-Cases.md#foreseeable-next-steps-tbc-at-on-of-the-next-meetings)
