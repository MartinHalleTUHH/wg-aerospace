## ELISA Aerospace Working Group

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.

# Technical Topics

## Discuss any topics from OSS North America

- Good cross presentation focus on requirements or definition of functionality to drive testing / coverage
  - Nvidia and Boeing had separate talks

## Use case demo (https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/tree/main/demos/copilot)

-	Brief update on Use Case demo work
  - Completed - native python demo of the CoPilot monitor and rehosted into a minimal ARM64 Linux (Documentation is pending)
  - Creating - similar demo with raw sockets and targeting a minimal Linux w/o network stack - Question is as follows:
    - Do we want to start an updated Use Case to represent this (maybe start from our current one and tailor?)
      - **Last Month's ACTION was sort of aligned** Start to write up a higher availability/safety focused use case
          - We could focused around the following to seed the discussion
            - **multi board simulation (multi-qemu with some watchdog / remedy behavior)**
            - **Fault injection into QEMU - memory / cpu faults**

- NASA standard vs DO-178 (Ivan had action from last call)
  - Hard to establish equivalency as reverse engineering practice would apply either direction when wanting to reuse artifacts.
  - **Action** - Ivan asking about fault rate
  - What about Human space vs non?

## Emulated OS discussion

- Discussion on collaborating on a minimal OS configuration
    - (Michael) attested boot - baremetal boot to Linux  (could be a interesting demo for minimal linux config)
    - (Matt W) reduced code count is a goal
    - ACTION - Aim towards capturing a new use case to help drive this direction
- Do we want to follow SGLâ€™s approach to licensing and collaboration agreements for AeroWG content?
  - https://github.com/elisa-tech/meta-sgl/blob/main/LICENSE
- [Github](https://github.com/elisa-tech/) or [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/elisa-tech/) ?
  - If Gitlab
      - Our CICD scales better
      - Thinking we use a subgroup so we can have a series of project repos

## Whitepaper on "Survey State of Art...""

Background
- Edits
  - Via online [Overleaf editor](https://www.overleaf.com/) - we have limited licenses so we've shared the pdf link below
  - latex format and editor can generate documents
- Paper's goal - What is the current state of the art with respect to aerospace
  - Initial document drove use case definition
  - Evolved to be a comparison and a conclusion of industry direction
  - Doc still informs goals and activities of AeroWG & Space

ACTIONS
- Martin can add you as an editor to the paper if you have contributions!  Or you can use our latest pdf on the mailing list and supply comments back in a marked up version.
