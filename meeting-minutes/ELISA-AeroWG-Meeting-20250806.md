## ELISA Aerospace Working Group

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.

# Announcements

## Meetings

- [TSC minutes](https://lists.elisa.tech/g/devel/topic/elisa_tsc_meeting/114449628)
  - OSS EU - [Booth representative](https://lists.elisa.tech/g/devel/topic/reminder_open_source_summit/114530882), Onsite meeting, discount codes and Discord channel.
  - Working on a November 18-20th workshop event.
  - Details on signing up for Discord and accessing our channels
  - Initial proposal around chartering a "Survey/Research about Quality of Open Source"

## Upcoming Events

- July 2025 - Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology Space Computing Conference IEEE (Pasadena, CA) (https://2025.smcit-scc.space/) (Occurring for 20yrs, cross industry/global)
  - Had a 2 day hands on F' tutorial - https://github.com/nasa/fprime
    - Alexey mentioned about adding to Yocto (Grabbing a contact for one of the F' demo leads that might have a start) (Matt plans to mention this to Ramon)
      - F' code generation and prep could be outside of Yocto (Yocto could be used to deploy/host)
      - F' vs cFS - cFS recipes would have less configuration aspects and easier to define a standard binary that could be produced.  Vs. tighter integration of the F' generated binaries
        - Could be something to investigate defining a default configuration against a SGL deployment.  Could start as a documentation activity.
        - cFS as a project is leaning towards a tool that generates a configuration (similar to F')
    - **ACTION**: Ramon, this could be a SGL call topic
- August 5th - Open Source Summit India - Hyderabad, India - https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-india/

# Technical Topics

## Use case demo

https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/tree/main/demos/copilot

-	Brief update on Use Case demo work
  - Cabin Lights
    - Completed - native python demo of the CoPilot monitor and rehosted into a minimal ARM64 Linux
    - Completed - similar demo with raw sockets and targeting a minimal Linux
    - Next step - documentation and present the demo
  - NASA Core Flight System (cFS)
    - Experimenting with a build for minimal ARM64 Linux emulation

## Whitepaper on "Survey State of Art..."

(Only touched on actions in today's call)

### Background
- Edits
  - Via online [Overleaf editor](https://www.overleaf.com/) - we have limited licenses so we've shared the pdf link below
  - latex format and editor can generate documents
- Paper's goal - What is the current state of the art with respect to aerospace
  - Initial document drove use case definition
  - Evolved to be a comparison and a conclusion of industry direction
  - Doc still informs goals and activities of AeroWG & Space

### NASA standard vs DO-178 (Ivan had action from last call)
  - Hard to establish equivalency as reverse engineering practice would apply either direction when wanting to reuse artifacts.
  - **Action** - Ivan sent a message to peers about fault rate

### ACTIONS
- Martin can add you as an editor to the paper if you have contributions!  Or you can use our latest pdf on the mailing list and supply comments back in a marked up version.
- Tim offered to help add items from "eLinux Space Research" linked above to the respective location in the paper where they're relevant

## Parking lot items

### Existing use case direction

Possible directions

- Go through the step of the example - lower the entry bar of performing the examples and customizing
- Get a similar example going with cFS.  Would constrain the cFS configuration to a demo stack that is monitored (good base to extend from)

Goal
- Get experience from users / feedback
- SWL-C - Outline what we would need to do to demo
  - Emulation
    - code conversion to C and reduce userspace content
  - HIL - use an accessible drone/HW people can access  (Could follow SGL hardware targets?)
  - **ACTION:**
    - Ivan - checking with CalPoly team (had some F' work shown at IEEE conf)
    - Martin, are you looking for student projects?
    - Ramon, are there any drone/HW ideas that come to mind that we should entertain?
- What are we measuring?
  - fault tolerant aspects
  - message / rate requirements
  - What other ideas do people have?

### New Use Case ideas

Focus ideas from July call
  - (Michael) attested boot - baremetal boot to Linux  (could be a interesting demo for minimal linux config)
  - (Matt W) reduced code count
