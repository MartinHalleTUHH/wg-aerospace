## ELISA Aerospace Working Group

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.

# Technical Topics

[Link to 2025 goals](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/meeting-minutes/ELISA-AeroWG-Meeting-20250205.md#2025-vision-and-direction)

## Flight Software Workshop out brief

- New mailing list subscribers
- Questions from the presentation
  - When to use Linux vs RTOS/Microcontroller?
  - Does SGL go beyond just testing to also produce the formal req, design, tracking ,etc require by FAA, NASA and Space Force safety standards?  Breaking the paradigm, "we can't verify the safety in , we have to build it in."
  - RTEMS vs. Linux
- Slides
  - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/presentations/ELISA-FSW-March2025.pdf   
  - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/presentations/Space%20Grade%20Linux%20Flight%20Software%20Workshop%202025%20Introduction%20-%20STRIVES%20Approved.pdf


## Whitepaper on "Survey State of Art...""

Background
- Edits
  - Via online [Overleaf editor](https://www.overleaf.com/) - we have limited licenses so we've shared the pdf link below
  - latex format and editor can generate documents
- Paper's goal - What is the current state of the art with respect to aerospace
  - Initial document drove use case definition
  - Evolved to be a comparison and a conclusion of industry direction
  - Doc still informs goals and activities of AeroWG & Space
- Martin has restructured the paper based on previous discussion
  - Why the paper / oveview
  - Why would you use OSS in safety critical
  - Challenges
  - Overview
    - closed solutions
    - RTOS  in Aero
    - Linux in other industries
    - Linux in aero and related considerations
  - Comparison / conclusion / criteria
- Paper started really focused and restructure started when the group became more diverse with standards and concerns
  - Suggestion in this call was to consider adjusting the standards language to not just focus on DO-178C but consider NASA / MIL guidance.
- Gaps
  - State of the art - how far back (e.g., Perseverance rover backshell camera control but thats older) - Yes
  - Mention of Phone SATs
  - SWL vs class levels mapped to examples  (human factor vs reliability)
      - Cross roads example could be Touch controls on Dragon

**Open actions**
- Martin - Update the overall abstract for the whitepaper (before we dive into sections)
    - Clear "state of the art" definition with supporting information which could support follow on papers / research specifically comparing approaches
- ALL - Feedback on survey document - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/docs/20250305_ELISA_AeroWG_Whitepaper.pdf
  - Propose what you believe the abstract is for this paper. How would you describe it in a couple mins.
  - What gaps do you see?
  - What is unclear?

## Discussion on Features for Aerospace
- Call between Ivan, Martin, Paul, Brian Wood, and I is occurring on testing wkly on Friday @ 9-9:30am CST. The meeting focuses on discussing the testing framework and how to prototype the components together. Anyone is welcome to join us https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/elisa-project?view=week.
