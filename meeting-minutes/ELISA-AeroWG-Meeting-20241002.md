## ELISA Aerospace Working Group

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.

# Technical Topics

## LPC outbrief

- **Videos (full length room videos) and slide links are under each of the talks "attachment" icons** - https://lpc.events/event/18/timetable/#all
- LLVMcov - Good talks and conversation with test and LLVM maintainers
- Linux Kernel design / req brainstorming (RT work being complete may be tech debt opportunity to look at testing...  maybe even requirements/assertions)
  - Do req become part of the code?
  - Looking at templates for req/design approach to align tools and code updates
  - Drive better testing
- Runtime verification (model based) - Daniel B's work - https://bristot.me/
  - Looking for contributors
  - Ivan does formal verification at NASA
- Supporting benchmark ranges of results within a kunit/kselftest environment
  - Definition of reference values and how to relate everyone's special configuration  (How do we do QA better?)
  - Everyone brings their thresholds and method of representing the values

## Space Grade Linux (SGL)

- Survey: [Shape the Future of Linux in Space](https://lists.elisa.tech/g/aerospace/topic/help_shape_the_future_of/108506014)
  - Feedback so far - we've got 7 responses, please SHARE it with your co-workers :-)  
  - Marking push pending staff recovering from LPC
  - End date (not set yet)

## December 10-12 Workshop

- Topics/tracks
  - Linux real-time status
  - De-mystify standards and how they relate to products
  - Testing
  - Simulation
  - Development Environment primer, how to start
    - Tooling talk at ELCE about easier setup of Yocto [TB] - Alex K
    - KAS tool for managing layers / set up
    - What is our tool set suggestions from Aero/Space WGs?  (What are we assembling for runtime scenarios?)
    - When Pokey vs move towards product
  - Functional hazard assessment overview
  - Notional space systems
    - What is required from the OS  (i.e. if you are using a cFE vs F' vs .. etc on top)
    - cFE vs F' vs .. discussion on frameworks use (cert, how used, arch, comms) [Ivan? discuss more next time]
    - Boot needs?
  - Filesystem reliability
  - Embedded systems reliability (SEU impacts) - Goddard - NASA NEPP talk?  [Christopher is checking]
- Who are our track leads?

## LFSCS: Randomization and the impact to safety
- Crypto lib from kernel is needed to run a program that "does nothing".
- Random function to set Kernel offset random, to make life harder for attackers.
  - Really useful in security. Different concern in safety.
- In higher level of safety (A/B in aerospace) to have predicable and testable behavior means heavier efforts to use random. It need to be easily verifiable on system level. There may be a tipping point in systems with less criticality where also security comes into picture as a stronger argument.
- Randomization makes the kernel allocation resource not predictable. 
  - If we have a variety of different methods, it could be up to the provider of the system to use this.
  - Thread analysis and attack vectors analysis can show, if there is a randomization needed.
- Without randomization the claims on safety could become easier from technical perspective.
- Determinism is not possible for all cases. There are functions in kernel space (which can be mostly deterministic), but in user space they may not be deterministic.
- Key message to be carried: "You need to be careful, when using randomization. You need to explain how you handle it, when it is switched on."
  - You could also start testing with randomization switched off and check behavior and switch on later and run your tests. 
- **Please respond also to Alessandro and the LFSCS what you think about randomization! Bring this forward in your working groups.**

ELISA kconfig safety suggestion is a big group of config options
- Do we create profiles that group "use cases" which drive config options?
- Do these profiles align to any of the standards levels/rigor?

How do we manage the knobs and what are defaults? [MW ask systems WG about components/elements documentation that already exists. ]

Chuck - Hazard drives software and security level of concern

## Discussion on Features for Aerospace

[STOPPED HERE]

In a prior meeting, we stopped at "use cases" and "System functional tests / measurement (blackbox)".

Continue the discussion series, now in a separate document:
[Aerospace-Uses-Cases](../Aerospace-Uses-Cases.md) -- [[Next steps]](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/Aerospace-Uses-Cases.md#foreseeable-next-steps-tbc-at-on-of-the-next-meetings)
