# Other business

- Carried over from previous meeting...
  - Do we need to introduce a dictionary? One example of a question that was raised:
    - What is the understanding of "multiple functions"? -> 3 Answers with 9 people
      - 1) Multiple PCI devices SATA, USB, network etc.
      - 2) PCI devices with multiple functions, root bridge can have multiple functions
      - 3) System function perspective: Applications (processes, tasks, functions as S/W components) to achieve a system function like switch on cabin light (example: read sensor, log data, report failure, drive actuator)
	- **NEW**: Tend to a common understanding of 3)
  - Space Grade Linux action - Contact Monaghan, Michael L. (GSFC-5870) <michael.l.monaghan@nasa.gov> to work on agenda and topics
