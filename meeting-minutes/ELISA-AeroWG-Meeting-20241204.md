## ELISA Aerospace Working Group

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.

# Technical Topics

## Meetings

- (Per TSC) Please note that all ELISA meetings from December 23-January 3 will be cancelled.
- (Per TSC) Starting from January 6th, we will use the LFX Meeting for all ELISA meetings. For a sneak peak of what that may look like please go to the ELISA public meeting calendar here https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/elisa-project. Currently we have the Safety Architecture meeting scheduled on the calendar and we will migrate all meetings to LFX Meeting during the December holiday break so they're ready to roll out in January. The meeting joining links will change and more details to receive a direct calendar invite will be shared as migration completes.

## Space Grade Linux SIG  - collaboration and codebase?

  - NASA Spark - https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/prizes-challenges-crowdsourcing-program/center-of-excellence-for-collaborative-innovation-coeci/nasa-spark/
    - SpaceROS advancements
    - Could use as a way for the community to contribute
    - Starting point for this group? - having an example deployment/build and some basic documentation
  - Stoke is resurrecting this one (Chris): https://github.com/SOL-Space-Operating-Linux/meta-sol
    - (MIT License) https://github.com/SOL-Space-Operating-Linux/Documentation/blob/master/LICENSE
  - Where would we host the space examples and what licensing / CLAs (https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/easycla/)?  (Michael checking internal to NASA on how this might work)
    - ACTION - Matt to follow up with Michael, Kate and Ramon to see if this is a SIG topic we breakout for.
      - [Matt] **Email sent to Kate, Ramon, Min, Martin and Michael**
      - [Matt] **I'd encourage those in person at the Workshop to discuss this topic**
  - **What do people think about breaking out Space topics in another call?** (Ideas below)
    - every two weeks at set time (vs offset to drive attendance)
    - calls grouped with specific tech side focus / aerospace requirements
    - establish a slack/Discord to start the out of band topics / development (would need to see where this applies and what topics work with this medium)
    - github / gitlab where do we centralize chats/discussions/issues/code dev/CICD/etc
    - allows longer threads and discussion to be managed (helps time zone disconnects)
    - AGL, most start with email and move over to Discord

## Discussion on Features for Aerospace

The use case discussion is focusing on testing.  

Open Actions
- Call between Ivan, Martin and I on testing (framework and prototyping the parts together)
- We are seeking volunteers to write the test apps and stage an emulation environment based on the discussion.  Contact Matt Weber if interested.
