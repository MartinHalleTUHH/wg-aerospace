# Use case call Minutes

## 20250912

ACTION - Martin made a discussion to capture future paper interest ideas and get some rough interest votes - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/discussions/94

AeroWG whitepaper call
1. Discuss the outline of the paper.
- off the ground topics
- why we do what we do, get interest in group

Do we limit to low/high and then do we talk about? - another paper?  Dornerworks comparing aerospace , auto and medical at a local conference.  

Survey - overview of the field
- summary of what's happening in th topic
- cutting edge research
- lots of references
- enter into conversation about what has been done which can be built upon
- constructed in a way that pulls out the threads and presents the field
- description of what needs to be done next, new research suggestions
- could observe there are multiple architectures in place but we generally don't form a opinion or suggestion (could be in a next paper)
10-15pages?

Literature review


Proposing how to organize state of the art  , how to apply
- deployment focus or do we use deployment to help structure the survey first?

Problem statement, what do we need to achieve to use it in our domains


In next call, what's the deployment we organize the focus around?

Ivan
- over thinking it
- process more then just doing steps
- lots of work on these fronts but ti's hard to track down
- paper is better then wikipedia
  - clear documented story
  - more visibility
  - community sees a push, sets a conversation
- people don't know what to write, what is the question?
  - phrase, what to add, how to add



1. Review the to-do list:
  - Outline material and set limits:
    - Aerospace goals.
    - Regulated environment considerations.
    - Justification for our focus.
  - Visualize the cabin/system/flight controls model (comparing the cabin to a cubesat in an aircraft):
    - Describe the overall system, then drill down into specific cabin systems.
    - Suggest developing a system model for space, allowing us to draw parallels with identified examples.
  - Define the general characteristics of an electronic aerospace system and its environment.

3. Scope the discussion to low design assurance (LOR-4 , SWL-D/E) for now, while solidifying the systems aspect:
  - General system overview.
  - Aircraft system specifics.
